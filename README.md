### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhanzoai%2Fchat&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,TAVILY_API_KEY,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN)

### Docker Prebuilt Image

Prebuilt Docker images are available on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
```

You can use it with docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  morphic:
    image: ghcr.io/miurla/morphic:latest
    env_file: .env.local
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      - ./models.json:/app/public/config/models.json # Optional: Override default model configuration
```

The default model configuration is located at `public/config/models.json`. For Docker deployment, you can create `models.json` alongside `.env.local` to override the default configuration.

## ⚡ AI SDK Implementation

### Current Version: AI SDK UI

This version of Hanzo Search uses the AI SDK UI implementation, which is recommended for production use. It provides better streaming performance and more reliable client-side UI updates.

### Previous Version: AI SDK RSC (v0.2.34 and earlier)

The React Server Components (RSC) implementation of AI SDK was used in versions up to [v0.2.34](https://github.com/hanzoai/chat/releases/tag/v0.2.34) but is now considered experimental and not recommended for production. If you need to reference the RSC implementation, please check the v0.2.34 release tag.

> Note: v0.2.34 was the final version using RSC implementation before migrating to AI SDK UI.

For more information about choosing between AI SDK UI and RSC, see the [official documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/getting-started/navigating-the-library#when-to-use-ai-sdk-rsc).
